// Rules for setting up files and folders in this CS learning repository:

// 1. Create a main directory for the repository (e.g., "cs-learning").
// 2. For each computer science domain or topic you explore, create a separate folder:
//    - algorithms
//    - data_structures
//    - networking
//    - security
//    - operating_systems
//    - databases
//    - web_development
//    - machine_learning
//    - hardware
//    - miscellaneous
// 3. Inside each domain folder, organize files by language or subtopic as needed.
// 4. Place a README.md in the root directory to describe the purpose of the repository and give an overview of the folder structure.
// 5. Add a .gitignore file in the root directory to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
// 6. Use clear and descriptive names for all files and folders.
// 7. For experiments or notes, create a "notes" or "experiments" folder within the relevant domain.
// 8. Store documentation, references, or guides in a "docs" folder at the root or within each domain as appropriate.
